Once this is agreed to, the husband would return the Mehr amount paid by the wife. Once the Mehr amount is received by the wife, she becomes a single lady. Her family would have to pay the dower money for her to marry someone else. The second stage of Khula is the actual divorce. The husband would have to go to the Sharia Court and seek the actual divorce. He would pay the required amount and then the Court would formally dissolve the marriage.</p>
